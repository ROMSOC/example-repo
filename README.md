# Example of a ROMSOC benchmark repository

## Summary
This is a typical example of a public repository with the minimal elements required to have a well documented and functional structure open source project hosted in GitHub.

## Description
The minimal structure of the repository should contain at least three elements: i) the source code, ii) a variety of benchmarks (or test-case scenarios), and iii) a documentation information (with installation and running instructions, which could be included also in the ``README.md`` file). No specific requirements are established regarding programing languages, the internal structure of the subfolders, type of license, file formats, or additional contents required for each particular repository.

## Directory structure
All the repositories should include at least the ``README.md`` (markdown file) and  ``LICENSE`` files with the general description and information about the code available in the repository. A possible folder structure of the repository could be desiged as follows:
```
.
├── source
│   └── source files (and subfolders if any)
├── benchmarks
    ├── data files (input)
    ├── result files (output)
│   └── source files (and subfolders if any)
├── documentation
│   └── source files (and subfolders if any)
├── CONTRIBUTORS
├── CHANGELOG
├── LICENSE
├── README
└── .gitignore
```
